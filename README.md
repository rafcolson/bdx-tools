BDX-Tools
=========

BDX-Tools is a collection of secondary tools for [BDX](https://github.com/GoranM/bdx), packaged as a [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) add-on.

BDX is a small 3D game engine, designed to work with [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) (as an add-on too), and built to leverage [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), along with the [Bullet physics library](http://bulletphysics.org/) (specifically, the [gbullet](http://code.google.com/p/gbullet/) port). Visit https://github.com/GoranM/bdx for more information about BDX.

Using these various tools could be helpful during the game development process, but should not be considered as a requirement to use BDX.

License
-------

BDX-Tools is licensed under the permissive [Apache 2 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) (just like BDX): You can use this software free of charge, no strings attached, in commercial and non-commercial projects.

Dependencies
------------

The BDX-Tools add-on will be usable if the [BDX add-on](https://github.com/GoranM/bdx/releases) is installed too and if a BDX project is created.

Download and Install
--------------------

You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/rafcolson/bdx-tools/releases).

Download *bdx-tools.zip*. Once you have it, you can install it like any other Blender add-on - In *User Preferences*, click on the *Install from File* button, then find and install *bdx-tools.zip*.

After that, you just need to enable it (you can find it in the *Import-Export* category - *Community* support level), and then *Save User Settings*, so you don't have to re-enable after every Blender restart.

At that point, all BDX tools can be accessed in the Dynamic Spacebar Menu by pressing the space bar in the 3D view.
